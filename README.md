# Unofficial COVID Tracking Project GraphQL API

A GraphQL wrapper for the API at the [COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/). I've been interested in building GraphQL APIs recently,
and in light of the current pandemic I thought it might be useful to practice on this API.

## Dependencies

This project is build primarily with Apollo Server, Express, and GraphQL Compose. It gets its data from https://api.covidtracking.com.
